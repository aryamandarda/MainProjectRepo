Description:

CS180_proj1.ipynb: This is the single notebook needed to run the code. It contains all the functions and can be run in order of cell arrangement. It is pre-saved with the results of the code for the grader to view with ease. 

Note: I have deleted the "data" folder to make it easier to submit. However, the code requires a data folder to be present in the same directory as the notebook. Hopefully you can work around this minor issue because I didn't have any other choice. 

Note: Images picked by me from the collection are in "own_images".

Note: Images on webpage might appear to be a bit distorted due to resizing for the webpage. 

Note: To rerun code on images I picked out, please move those images to a folder called "data" from "own_images".
