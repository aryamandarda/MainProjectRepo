Description:

ImageMorphing.ipynb: This is the single notebook needed to run the code. It contains all the functions and can be run in order of cell arrangement.

The "data" folder contains the input images used as part of the project. 

The "output" folder contains all the processed images and intermediary steps necessary in achieving the results. 

Each of the ".json" files contain the correspondence points for warping of various pairs of images.

Note: For part 4, 5, the following dataset was used: https://web.archive.org/web/20210305094647/http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/datasets/datasets.html

However, this had to be deleted from the submission due to size limitations. Part 4 and part 5 will not run as expected unless this dataset is downloaded and placed into "../data/population/" folder.
