FunWithFreq.ipynb: This is the single notebook needed to run the code. It contains all the functions and can be run in order of cell arrangement.

The "data", "hybrid_python", and "spline" folders contain the input images used as part of the project. The "output" folder contains all the processed images and intermediary steps necessary in achieving the results.
