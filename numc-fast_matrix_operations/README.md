I essentially used a lot of SIMD instructions to speed up most of my for loops along with openMP to give that extra thread-level parallelism boost. I implemented the algorithm of Repeated Squaring which I learned in CS 170 to significantly boost my pow method speedup.
### Provide answers to the following questions.
- How many hours did you spend on the following tasks?
  - Task 1 (Matrix functions in C): 4
  - Task 2 (Speeding up matrix operations): 20
- Was this project interesting? What was the most interesting aspect about it?
  - <b>So I absolutely loved this project! I thought it was super cool that we actually got to use algorithms we learned in 70/ 170 to speedup pow as well as the power of parallelism to speedup functions which I thought could not be sped up in that way.</b>
- What did you learn?
  - <b>I learned how to better use resources on the internet along with how to effectively use SIMD instructions and openMP instructions.</b>
- Is there anything you would change?
  - <b>Honestly nothing much I would change. I think the project is the perfect length for something so late in the semester and it truly is super captivating!</b>
