Proj5.ipynb: This is the single notebook needed to run the code. It contains all the functions and can be run in order of cell arrangement.  

The "Data" folder contains the input images and the "Output" folder contains all the final and intermediate images.

Note: High resolution raw images have been deleted from the data folder in order to submit the project to Gradescope. Please work with images labelled "resized" in the "data" folder.
