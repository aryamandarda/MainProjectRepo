Description:

Performing Optical Character Recognition using the PaddleOCR framework to detect characters within images from diverse fonts and languages. PaddleOCR's flexibility and extensibility allows for efficient performance in text recognition tasks and models can be tailored to specific applications. 

This work demonstrates the use of PaddleOCR in basic text detection and recognition of the English font using Kaggle's Total-Text dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipythonx/totaltextstr. and a few others.

Usage:
'Train PaddleOCR.ipynb': main notebook to run code for text detection and recognition. 
'configs': contains configs for the recognition and detection models based on specific datasets.
